             CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES

         <p>
             Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track (“DNT”)
             feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online
             browsing activities monitored and collected. No uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing
             DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other
             mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online
             tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised
             version of this privacy policy.
